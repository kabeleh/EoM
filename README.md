Equations of Motion from a Lagrangian

This rep contains mathematica files that use the xAct package and different approaches to derive the equations of motion from a specified Lagrangian in a flat Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker universe with a first order perturbation in a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition.

All definitions are self-contained in each notebook, i.e. the notebook should run stand-alone.

A big thanks to the xAct user group https://groups.google.com/g/xact and its committed members.
