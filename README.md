# EoM
Equations of Motion from a Lagrangian

This rep contains mathematica files that use the xAct package and different approaches to derive the equations of motion from a specified Lagrangian in a flat Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker universe with a first order perturbation in a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition.

All definitions are self-contained in each notebook, i.e. the notebook should run stand-alone. However, xPand starts with the abstract expressions derived using xPert that are included in the EoM_xCoba.nb.

A big thanks to the xAct user group https://groups.google.com/g/xact and its committed members.

# xTras
The EoM_xTras.nb directly derives the equations of motion in a metric-dependent way.

# xCoba
The EoM_xCoba.nb derives abstract equation of motion using xPert and re-expresses these expressions then by the means of xCoba in a metric-dependent way.

# xPand
The EoM_xPand.nb starts with the equations of motion in abstract notation (derived using xPert) and re-expressed them in a metric-dependent way.
